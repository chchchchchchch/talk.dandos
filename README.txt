 TOWARDS SITUATED SOFTWARES
 ==========================
(TALK AT THE DAN-D FESTIVAL 2016)
 -------------------------------

 After heydays of networked culture we're currently
 experiencing homogenisation and centralisation
 across all areas of our digital environments.

 While free/libre/open source software offers an
 alternative beyond brushed metal and creative clouds
 it is not the easy answer to complex questions.

 After doing graphic design from within the ecosystem
 of free/libre/open source culture for some years,
 it's time again to recapitulate and share experiences.
 The lecture revisits various projects and tries
 to situate them towards a practise, where
 f/l/os might provide the means for radical
 localisation, empowering partial perspectives
 and distributed responsibilities.
